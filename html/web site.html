Rockstar Games has, at last, unveiled what could arguably be the most significant gaming announcement of the year after nearly two years of speculation and rumors. The release date for Grand Theft Auto 6, or GTA 6, has been revealed in the highly anticipated trailer.
For the initial time since the leaks surfaced in 2022, we will now have the opportunity to discover the details of the upcoming GTA edition. The leaks provided glimpses into the game's development and introduced us to some new features Rockstar was experimenting with. However, a substantial amount of time has passed since then, and we anticipate that many aspects of the game have evolved.

One of the biggest questions about GTA 6 is about its location. Where will GTA 6 be set? Well all signs are pointing toward Florida, and one fan has put together a map of what they think the location will be based off of the leaks from 2022. Fans online constructed the possible map for GTA 6 based on leaked clips, where they gathered the coordinates and pieced together what looks to be a pretty convincing recreation of something yet to be confirmed. The GTA 6 first trailer will be arriving on December 5th at 9am ET so we'll know a lot more about it after the #GTA6 Rockstar games trailer drops. For now, we'll be looking at what we know about where GTA 6 is located, and speculate on all the leaked locations we'd love to see once the trailer drops. Is this #RockstarGames making a return to #ViceCity? Weâ€™ll find out soon.
